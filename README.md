# Plinko-Table-Math-Model
First create a Model for a Plinko Table which is well known to have an ideal distribution. Next modify the distribution to be deterministic.

1.Define the constraints of the Table:
  a. There are 3 walls the "Ball" can not pass
  b. There are som quantity of pegs separated by rows "layers" and staggered columns
  c. There are inputs or locations the "Ball" can be inserted
  d. There are outputs or locations the "ball" can exist as a steady state
  e. There needs to be a physics engine for the ball, the physics will allow a definition of the stability

An AI or Machine Learning Model can be developed for anything for as long as you can describe the data. The data will always be the input. 
The output needs to be understood. This application is suggested to have an easily expected out come. The outcome can be confirmed using probability and statistics, 
we can use this to verify the machine is correct.
